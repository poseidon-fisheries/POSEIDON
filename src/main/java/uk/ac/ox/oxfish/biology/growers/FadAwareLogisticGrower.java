/**
 * The FadAwareLogisticGrower is like a CommonLogisticGrower, but calculates growth by using the
 * memorized biomass from the previous year instead of using the current biomass.
 * This grower takes FAD biomass into account as part of the total memorized biomass, but only
 * redistributes new biomass in ocean cells. When the growth function is called, it also adds back
 * biomass that was lost by FADs drifting out of habitable ocean cells. If no FADs are present, it
 * works just like a CommonLogisticGrower (except of course for the memorized biomass bit).
