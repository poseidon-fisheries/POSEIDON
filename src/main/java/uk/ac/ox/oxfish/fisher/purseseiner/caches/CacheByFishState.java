/**
 * This class makes it easy to cache objects that should be reused within the same simulation.
 * It's an alternative to {@code uk.ac.ox.oxfish.utility.Locker}, with the added benefit that
 * the cache can potentially be queried in parallel by multiple simulations.
 * <p>
 * Great care should be taken however, to avoid caching objects that hold a reference back to the
 * {@code FishState}, otherwise the entries will never be collected. One possible gotcha: don't
 * hold on to a stoppable that's created from an {@code AggregateSteppable}, as those might include
 * references to all sorts of stuff you don't expect (true story).
