/**
 * a permit allocation policy that is simply given a list of percentages of boats to allow out each year.
 * There is no randomness: the boats are allowed by order given by the ID (so for example .27 means that the first 27% of the boats are allowed out
 * as ordered by their ID). <br>
 * total_number_of_boats = floor(max * percentage) <br>
 *
 * If there are more years simulated than the list of percentages given, just always return the last given percentage
 *
 * This is mostly useful to force a fixed effort through the years (which is useful for MERA comparisons)
