/**
 * Aggregate steppable is a collection of steppables that are pulsed without randomization. It's a simple hack to speed up
 * model.schedule. <p>
 * The problem is simple: MASON schedule randomizes everything all the time. When there are a lot of steppables the
 * randomization becomes expensive and painfully slow. This is due to the fact that the heap is simply too crowded. <p>
 * But many StepOrder of the model do not need randomization and can happen in any order (data-collection for example).
 * Those steppables then are aggregated in one of these objects so that the MASON steppable only has to deal with it.
