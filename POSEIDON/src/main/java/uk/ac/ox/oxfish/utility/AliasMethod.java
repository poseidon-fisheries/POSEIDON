 * File: AliasMethod.java
 * Author: Keith Schwarz (htiek@cs.stanford.edu)
 *
 * An implementation of the alias method implemented using Vose's algorithm.
 * The alias method allows for efficient sampling of random values from a
 * discrete probability distribution (i.e. rolling a loaded die) in O(1) time
 * each after O(n) preprocessing time.
 *
 * For a complete writeup on the alias method, including the intuition and
 * important proofs, please see the article "Darts, Dice, and Coins: Smpling
 * from a Discrete Distribution" at
