This is the code for POSEIDON, a fishery agent-based model; currently under review but open-source under GPL.
For all intents and purposes please consider this code pre-alpha.   

A good run-down of what it is and does is available here:

How to run
==============================

This is a simple gradle project. As long as you have an updated version of java on your computer you can just type in the terminal

    ./gradlew run
    
and it will download libraries, compile sources and run the program. If you are not on linux/mac you just use ```gradle.bat``` instead.

Most IDEs should be able to open the project just by reading the ```build.gradle``` file.
